// Note that attempt is a static function so that it can be overloaded in a
// conditional extension. I'm not sure if this is intended behavior or a
// limitation of Swift. Also note that a convenience attempt that takes in
// an array of terms cannot be defined since it would never choose a 
// conditional overload (because of how Swift generic work), and thus will
// cause unexpected, silent failures with recursive unification types.
